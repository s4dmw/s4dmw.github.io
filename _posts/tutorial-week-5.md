#### Week 5 Tutorial: [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

##### what is it?
- jQuery is a javaScript library that wraps all of the element selector commands up in to a nice tidy package. It eliminates the need for using most of the different vanilla DOM javaScript element selector commands.

##### why should I use it?
- you should use it because it can make your life easier when your dealing with DOM javaScript. Haven't you wanted to be able to select an element without remembering all of those querySelector commands? Me too! Now you just need to know $().

##### how do I use it?
`$("sectionn#sample.active");` will select the 'section' element with 'sample' id and 'active' class
`$("sectionn#sample.active").click(function((){..commands..});` will create an event listener on that element and execute the function when it is clicked
