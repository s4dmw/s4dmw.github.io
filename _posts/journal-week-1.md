##### What I learned in my first week of FEE at TIY...

The first week of the Front End Engineering cohort at The Iron Yard was a fun filled learning experience. YAY!  Each day of the first week started off with student orientation where we learned some rules, meet some people, talked about parking, and met some more people.

Once we dug in to our lectures and labs, we dove head first in to some of the tools and methods we will need as software developers. Git and GitHub are essential tools that I have already developed a love hate relationship with. Mostly hate. Do I push, pull, fork, clone, or merge? Who really even knows? I have gotten more comfortable with using the CLI for git purposes which seems like a step in the right direction. A few of the other tools we be using are node, atom, and slack. In general these seem to cause fewer nightmares than Git/GitHub.

Javascript is one of the core languages we are focusing on in FEE and after a week using it, I thought I had a pretty good grasp of it. That was until we started talking about using it in conjunction with CSS and HTML. Houston we (might) have a problem. Back to the first week though, we learned about the four primitive types, functions, loops, and logical testing.

Overall, it was an interesting week. I learned first hand what immersive education is all about and I haven't drowned yet. Progress?
