#### Browersync: Making Your Life Easier One Reload At A Time

##### Why should I care about browsersync?
Have you ever been working on website and had to reload the page every single time you saved the changes? Well not anymore folks! Those days are over...done! What if I told you that you could see changes as they are saved? Without ever leaving the window you're making those changes in? Would you beleive me? Would you buy it? Well guess what...it does exist and IT'S FREE!!!!!

##### FREE? You must tell me more!
That's right folks! Let me tell you a little bit about the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's creatively named browsersync and it...wait for it...syncs your browser to the files it's tracking. It can even play the role of a server so others can watch the magic happen too!

So head right on over to [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) and check it out!

##### So now what?
Well, now it's time to install it!
It's as simple as 1...2...3, or at least cutting and pasting the following command in to your terminal window: `npm install -g browser-sync`. Wow, that sounds too easy. Maybe, maybe not. if you had trouble installing, check out [this site](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) for some possible solutions. 

#### You're right, that was easy! How do I turn this crazy thing on?
To get Browsersync up and running, simply use this command: `browser-sync start --server --files "<files>"`. Ok, this time enter the file(s) you want to track in the `< >`. Better? Now sit back...well, sit up and type away to make those changes and watch the browser window magically refresh when you save changes.

#### What can I do with all this new found free time?
That's a great question. Now that browsersync has saved you countless minutes of clicking reload or Ctrl-R, you'll be able to take up a new hobby. I took up knitting and after 3 years I was able to knit this sock for a toddler!!!
