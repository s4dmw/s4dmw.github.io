#### Tears On My Keyboard: A Journal of Week 2

The emotional rollercoaster week of Front End Engineering started off with a holiday. Normally this would be a good thing, but in the FEE world this means that the amount of pain of a normal week is spread out over fewer days.  Higher pain per day factor can't be good for anyone!! Right?

Adding to the pain, the week was full of conflicts. Merge conflicts to be exact. We spent countless hours, days, weeks, resolving, pushing, pulling, rinsing, repeating. By the end of week two, I was completely exhausted but my GitHub house was in order.

The flow of our control was way off this week. One might say it was altered. We spent some time looping, functioning, conditioning, and operating on our precedence to get the control back.

The object of dis-array might seem unclear but if you dig deeper, there are many properties that can be accessed in their own ways. If you have the right keys and the proper values, you too can unlock the dictionaries and discover a whole world.

One glimmer of hope for the week was getting to indulge in my love of all things coffee. Never in my life have I encountered as much mocha and chai being used in java...script.

At some point during week two, we started reading blueprints in an attempt to build a better DOMe. We even(t) listened to clicking noises, things changing, and there were mouse events everywhere. Before I knew it, all the things (html, css, and javasrcipt) were working in perfect harmony.

Lastly, I worried about my health. I came down with a wicked URL that threatened to sideline me for most of the week. Luckily we found the host and eliminated the path(ogens). I wasn't sure what the protocol was with recovering from a URL but we ended up drinking a lot of nice port wine.


### Journal, Week 2

You should be working on your Final Draft (in a couple revisions) for tomorrow. Make sure you have some peers review your work and get your 2x :+1: ...and some extra eyes to pick out spelling and grammar mistakes! While you're reviewing the work of others, thoughtfully reflect on their journal and leave them a positive comment, a potential improvement or constructive criticism, and a **tl;dr** summary on their PR, even if someone else has already written something. You need _at least_ 2x :+1:'s... don't settle for the minimum.
