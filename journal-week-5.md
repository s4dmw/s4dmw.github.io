#### Journal: Week 5 - Chessboard of DOoM

Week five saw the return of everyone's favorite assignment. Sarcasm for the most part but this one is near and dear to our fearless leader's heart. The chessboard project caused a near meltdown of the class the first time around. What would happen this time??

Chessboard? That sounds easy? It's just an 8x8 square grid, right? Yep, that's exactly what it is but when you try to simulate the opening moves of a chess game using javascript, it get's a little more complicated. At first swipe, the goal of the assignment seemed to be just getting chess pieces to move around on a the board. But the goal was much...much bigger than that. The root of the assignment was to teach about MVC's and how the model(s), view, and controller(s) work together and how they can all be tested.

The first time around, I placed too much emphasis on just getting the pieces to do what want. I ended up hitting the target, for the most part, but missing the goal by a mile. The second time around, Dave (our instructor) placed even more emphasis on the importance of the model (the "game") and testing it instead of just seeing the moves. I put all of my focus on getting the model properly working and tested, before even considering how I was going to get the view (browser window) to display the moves.

This approach gave me a much greater understanding/appreciation for the relationship of the MVC and I think that just might have been the goal all along...
