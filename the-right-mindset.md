Research The Growth Mindsets by Dr. Carol Dweck, starting with the videos provided below. Document your sources on your wiki page, targeting a short (3 - 5 paragraphs) journal entry that includes all of the following:

#### summarizes the two mindsets and characteristics of each
##### growth mindset (yet) -
- reacts to a difficult challenge positively
- understand that their abilities could be developed
- have a 'not yet' attitude
- lots of brain activity when they conftont an error, they engage it deeply
- they learn from errors and correct them

##### fixed mindset (now) - 
- don't respond well to difficult challenges
- feel like a failure for not being able to solve the problem now
- crushed by the tryranny of now
- they run from difficulty
- hardly any electrical brain activity as they confronted an error, they dont engage it

The two mindsets revealed by Dr. Dweck's research are the growth mindset and the fixed mindset. She found that subjects with the growth mindset responded more positively to difficult challenges and understood that although they might not able to solve some difficult problems yet, they could develop the ability to solve them later. The key to this is their "not yet" attitude. When they encounter errors, they had a higher measured brain activity than their fixed mindset counterparts. The subjects with the growth mindset frequently learned from their errors and corrected them.

Subjects with a fixed mindset did not respond well to difficult challenges and often felt like a failure for not being able to solve a problem. Dr. Dweck described them as feeling "crushed by the tyranny of now" and asserted that they often avoid difficult problems.

#### either describe a personal situation in which you experienced each mindset or describes which aspects of each mindset you recognize in yourself
-it bothers me when i cant pick up concepts quick but i do understand they they take time so i dont let myself
get discouraged
- understand that their abilities could be developed
- have a 'not yet' attitude
- they learn from errors and correct them

I see characteristics of both mindsets in myself but primarily view myself as having a growth mindset. While it does bother me when I can't learn a concept as quickly as i would like, i understand that my abilities can be developed further. I try my best to learn from errors and not get discouraged.



#### explains how you will apply this understanding to your experience at The Iron Yard
-just because i may not be great at FEE yet, doesnt mean i can't be one day

I plan to use the concept of the growth mindset to help me succeed in my Iron Yard course. I expect there to be many occasions in which I don't understand the concepts at first. Knowing that I can work at developing those skills should keep me on track throughout the program.

If you need guidance, follow the writing process: start by brainstorming some ideas about the topic and write an outline of your essay, no more than three levels deep, on your wiki page. Otherwise, you can start with your first Rough Draft -- very unorganized, stream of consciousness.

This assignment will be due on Thursday, but we'll review everyone's work so far in class on Tuesday. Be sure to link your wiki page in your WIP Issue!
