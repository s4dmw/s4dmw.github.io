Research The Growth Mindsets by Dr. Carol Dweck, starting with the videos provided below. Document your sources on your wiki page, targeting a short (3 - 5 paragraphs) journal entry that includes all of the following:

#### summarizes the two mindsets and characteristics of each
##### growth mindset (yet) -
- reacts to a difficult challenge positively
- understand that their abilities could be developed
- have a 'not yet' attitude
- lots of brain activity when they conftont an error, they engage it deeply
- they learn from errors and correct them

##### fixed mindset (now) - 
- don't respond well to difficult challenges
- feel like a failure for not being able to solve the problem now
- crushed by the tryranny of now
- they run from difficulty
- hardly any electrical brain activity as they confronted an error, they dont engage it

#### either describe a personal situation in which you experienced each mindset or describes which aspects of each mindset you recognize in yourself
-

#### explains how you will apply this understanding to your experience at The Iron Yard
-


If you need guidance, follow the writing process: start by brainstorming some ideas about the topic and write an outline of your essay, no more than three levels deep, on your wiki page. Otherwise, you can start with your first Rough Draft -- very unorganized, stream of consciousness.

This assignment will be due on Thursday, but we'll review everyone's work so far in class on Tuesday. Be sure to link your wiki page in your WIP Issue!
