#### The wonderful world of CSS

The hot topic FEE topic of week three at the iron yard was Cascading Style Sheets. More commonly known by it's street name CSS. We spent most of the third week covering CSS and responsive web design.

Right now you're probably asking yourself "WTF are you talking about?" and so was I just a week ago. CSS can basically be thought of as the stuff that makes web sites/pages look good. Responsive design keeps those web pages looking good on multiple device types (phones, tablets, desktop monitors, and even watches now).

One of the key ingredients of responsive design is the media query. These mystical media queries let the CSS know which settings to apply to which device types and sizes. Drilling down in to responsive design even further, you get to desktop first vs mobile first vs tablet first design principles. The direction you choose will likely be decided by which device type your site might be viewed on the most. Once you design for a specific device, you only make the necessary changes to make the website suitable for viewing on the other devices.

Proceed in to the world of CSS with caution though. There are plenty of rabbit holes to venture down and it can become an OCD nightmare...
