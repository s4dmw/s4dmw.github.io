##### Reflective Journal - Week 6:

possible topics:
- half-time week - some review, some new topics
- reflect on the first half of the cohort. the cycle of learning/stress/fatigue
- lodash templates

projects:
- return of the blueprints - group project, built from scratch
- turning our journals in to a blog

A Reflective Journal is NOT a play-by-play of the last week, it's a reflection on what you've learned and how you've been challenged and grown. It shouldn't be more than 3 to 5 paragraphs; mention and link to your projects for the week!
