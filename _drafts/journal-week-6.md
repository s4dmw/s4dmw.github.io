##### Reflective Journal - Week 6: Half-time week

Most think of half time as a break for the team to regroup and plan for the second half. Our half time week was more akin to "let's play another game in between the two halves" kind of week. The pace of the class has steadily increased and that trend doesnt seem to be changing anytime soon! This is what I expected coming in but that doesn't make this any less traumatic.

The first half of the co-hort was rapid fire learning about html, css/scss, and a whole lot of javascript. The fundamentals have sunk in for the most part and each new step we take reinforces our foundational knowledge of front-end concepts.

Half-time week saw the return of the blueprints to give us some refreshers on basic html, css, and javascript/jQuery. We had to build a couple of simple pages from a boilerplate and it was actually a pretty enjoyable project that we got to do in pairs. We also began turning our journal posts in to a blog which has been pretty slow and painful for me...

I feel a little more beat up this week than I did last. It's wild what lack of sleep can do and it seems like everyone in the class is right there with me.
