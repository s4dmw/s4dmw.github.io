##### Reflective Journal - Week 6: Half-time week

Most think of half time as a break for the team to regroup and plan for the second half. Our half time week was more of a "let's play some overtime in between the two halves" kind of week. The pace of the class has steadily increased and that trend doesnt seem to be changing anytime soon!

The first half of the co-hort was rapid fire learning about html, css/scss, and most of all javascript. The fundamentals have sunk in for the most part and each new step we take reinforces our our foundational knowledge of the fundamental front-end topics.

We saw the return of the blueprints last week as refreshers on html, css, and javascript/jQuery. We had to build a couple of simple pages from a boilerplate and it was actually a pretty enjoyable project that we got to do in pairs. We also began turning our journal posts in to a blog which has been pretty slow and painful for me...
