##### Resource Week 7: Don't Overthink It Grids

This weeks super duper helpful resource link is: [Chris Coyier's 'Don't Overthink It Grids' ](https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/)

This site has been a great help for creating simple grid layouts. I'm finally starting to ween myself off of using the site but it is still a great resource for me. It provides a straight forward method, with plenty of examples, for building basic grids.
