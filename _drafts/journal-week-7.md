##### Journal Week 7

Week 7 included a group project that consisted of (re)building some Etsy pages. The class was divided in to groups of three and each group was tasked with building specific features for the pages. Each team would have a team lead and that position would rotate though the team throughout the duration of the project.

As team lead, you were not allowed to do any coding (make commits to the project). Your duties mainly included planning, helping find resources, and reviewing code.

What did I learn during this project? While I understand the value of planning, I did not fully grasp just how important it is with respect to software development. More time spent planning could have saved us some coding time through less trial/error and code rework. In the future, I will try to map out as much of the project as possible before diving in to the coding. Most of the important things I learned from the project fall in to the category of planning. 

One of the major hurdles we faced was merging each group's features in to the overall project. Similarly, some features were made up of sub features that would have to be combined before being merged into the overall project. Time permitting, it would have been very beneficial to build the project from the top down instead of from the bottom up. In this case, that would mean building the overall container for the features and giving each feature it's own container (place holder).

While this project was painful at times, it was a value learning opportunity that helped us prepare for our final projects.
