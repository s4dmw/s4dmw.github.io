#### Journal: Week 5 - Chessboard of DOoM

Week five saw the return of everyone's favorite assignment. That's sarcasm for the most part but this one is near and dear to our fearless leader's heart. The chessboard project nearly caused a meltdown of the class the first time around. What could possibly go wrong??

Chessboard? That sounds easy? Isn't it just an 8x8 square grid? That's exactly what it is, but when you try to simulate the opening moves of a chess game using javascript, it get's a little more complicated. The goal of the assignment seemed to be getting chess pieces to move around on the board. The real goal was much...much bigger than that. The root of the assignment was to teach us about MVC's and how the model(s), view, and control(s) work together and how they can all be tested.

The first time around, I placed too much emphasis on getting the pieces to move on the board the way I wanted them to. I ended up hitting the target, for the most part, but missing the goal by a mile. The second time around, Dave (instructor Dave, not classmate Dave...which would be me) placed even more emphasis on the importance of the model (the "game") and testing it instead of just seeing the moves. I put all of my focus on getting the model properly working and tested, before even considering how I was going to get the view (browser window) to display the moves.

This approach gave me a much greater understanding/appreciation for the relationship of the MVC and I think that just might have been the goal all along...

As painful as the assignment was (both times), It appreciate it a lot more now after getting closer to the goal.
