Journal, Week 1

You've just completed your first week at The Iron Yard. You've learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. Consider this a draft that you'll revise a few times throughout the week. Put this work in a branch called journal-week-1 in your USERNAME.github.io repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your WIP Issue! Here are some suggestions for topics:

What do developers do? What principles of a developer have you learned?
What is Pair Programming and what kinds of Pair Programming are there?
What is Test-Driven Development?
